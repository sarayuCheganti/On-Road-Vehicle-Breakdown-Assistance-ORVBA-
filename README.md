====On Road Vechicle BreakDown Assistance====

The project is if we have a car breakdown in the center of the city it is easy to find a mechanic or mechanical shop but if car breakdown in the highways or any forest areas it ll be very difficult to find a mechanic so this project helps to find the nearby mechanic


It's a basic website when we enter we'll be having two options either to register as a user or  a mechanic.once registered user can login and find the nearby mechanic by giving there area it's shows details of mechanics and their contact numbers based on the area 
Mechanics can only register once registered we store their data in database and users contact them by phone number they gave during the registration.
